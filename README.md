# Workout_Tracker

## Description 

This is a CWRU coding bootcamp homework assignment practicing Node.js, express, the non-sequelized database of MongoDB and Mongoose.  The project tests the students ability to incorporate the NPM mongoose database with a MVC file structure.  The project also incorporates using a model schema to allow the user to create workouts and add them to a dashboard that displays their workout progress.  The project practices the ability to get, post, and put using API routes.  This project utilizes the MVC (Model-View-Controller) file set up.  The project also incorporates the ability to deploy an app onto heroku and use MongoDB Atlas database and Amazon Web Service to host the data.

AS A USER I would like a simple application that I can use to track my workout time and weight to see if I am making progress and getting swole.
